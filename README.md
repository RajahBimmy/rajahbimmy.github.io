### GitHub Pages stuff
To get this to work on GitHub pages (while still having a versioned history of this site) I've moved all the files/folders from `dist` to this level. This includes the following:

```
index.html
dennis_mcdaid_resume.pdf
js/
css/
img/
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
