          Hey! I'm Dennis McDaid, a software developer obsessed with hockey, photography, and learning cool shit. This is my new and improved personal website, and I'm glad you've taken the time to read it! Here you'll find a list of my greatest hits in the portfolio section, some blog posts, and potentially music if I ever get around to mixing the tracks I've had laying around for the last few years. Below is a bit of background about me and my contact can be found at the very bottom of the page.
