title: Code Complete - Section 1
---

Five chapters and two hundred pages into _Code Complete_ make it clear that author Steve McConnell sees a conversation at place in the field which I never even knew existed. To me it boils down to Software Development as flowing art vs. structured method.

Preparing for the Colloquium, I couldn't be more glad that McConnell invokes Fred Brooks' _The Mythical Man-Month_ when criticizing the idea that writing software is comparable to drafting a letter, with no worries if entire chunks of the program need to be wholly scrapped to make room for new ideas. Not even 50 pages in, and McConnell immediately calls out Brooks' comparison as being imaginative but impractical, specifically stating that this is "poor advice for software development where a major system already costs as much as a 10-story office building or an ocean liner."

When coding for classes, I find myself conforming to the Brooks view quite frequently, testing and tearing apart large chunks of methods when realizing my own naivety with earlier implementations. Building programs for my job, however, definitely steers me more into the realm of McConnell. Tossing out a class at work on Thursday might mean that three quarters of the work I did Tuesday is now completely lost in the ether. I think the correct answer in developing software is somewhere in the middle. McConnell makes it obvious that software development should be mapped out well before any coding is done, rather than just diving right into the writing. Following the idea of software accretion, or gradual growth, I've found the best practice is to map a little, code enough to have a general interface to work with, then with a more concrete feel for what this project can or can't be, dive into the big beast of real architecture.
