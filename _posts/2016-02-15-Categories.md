title: Aristotle's Categories
---

Aristotle and Steve McConnell would've been best friends if the two ever crossed paths. Reading _Categories_, it's hard to find any aspect of abstraction or object-oriented programming that doesn't borrow directly from Aristotle.

#### Inheritance

Right from the get-go, Aristotle explains that "some things are both predicated of and are in a subject". Humans and oxen are both animals, however they differ in their specific type of animal, as a human does not have many of the key features which makes an ox an ox. Understanding how two classifications can belong to the same hierarchy without being the same exact things in and of themselves is Inheritance 101.

#### Instantiation

Aristotle writes that all things have Substance, Quantity, Quality, Relation, Where, When, Position, Possession, Action, and Passion. By his definition, a primary substance is a generic model of what that thing may be, whereas secondary substances are tangible instances of said models. This is exactly what McConnell talks about when he introduces the debate between class and object, with classes acting like blueprints for the objects which will be created. In the same way, instantiation does not make one object more correct than another. When building classes, there are certain pieces of data we may use to determine priority for sorting, but it's impossible "for one 'man' [object to be] more 'man' than another, as one 'white thing' is more or less 'white than another'."

"Some things consist of parts, having position with respect to each other, but others of parts not having such position." Much like in the inheritance argument made earlier, we see how there are certain attributes which make an animal an animal (brain, body, etc.), but there are also secondary features which allow for specificity and description. In some cases, the relationships between these traits can inform each other, in others, they may be purely cosmetic. Relationships between types is also highly informative. A little mountain is still much larger than a gigantic anthill, and this knowledge of relationship and scale continue to better inform the abstraction process.
