          Make yourself at home, I've got a few neat projects up top and more professional info on the bottom. This site and most of the projects below are meant to highlight a lot of the web dev stuff I've done, but if you check out my <a href="https://github.com/RajahBimmy">Github</a>, you'll find some cool non-web stuff as well. This site was built using Jekyll and Github-Pages, and if you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code">Konami Code</a>, you'll probably have some fun here.
